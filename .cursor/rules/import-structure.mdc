description: Standards for organizing imports
alwaysApply: true

Imports should be organized in the following order, with a blank line between each group:

1. React and Next.js imports

```tsx
import { type FC } from "react";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import Image from "next/image";
```

2. External library imports

```tsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod";
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
```

3. Shadcn component imports

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
```

4. Internal component imports (using aliases)

```tsx
import { Header } from "@/components/layout/header";
import { Footer } from "@/components/layout/footer";
```

5. Internal utility imports

```tsx
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
import { useAuth } from "@/lib/hooks/use-auth";
```

6. Type imports

```tsx
import type { User } from "@/lib/types";
```

Additional rules:

- Use named imports with curly braces
- Always use type imports for TypeScript types
- Use absolute imports with @/ alias instead of relative paths
- Sort imports alphabetically within each group
- Remove unused imports
- Avoid \* imports
- Use explicit named exports instead of default exports
