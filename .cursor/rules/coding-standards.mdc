- Follow KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Use early returns to reduce nesting and improve readability
- Use Tailwind classes for styling; avoid CSS files
- Use "class:" instead of ternary operators in class attributes
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Event handlers should be prefixed with "handle" (e.g., handleClick, handleSubmit)
- Implement proper accessibility features:
  - Add aria-labels
  - Use proper semantic HTML
  - Ensure keyboard navigation works
  - Add proper focus management
- Use shadcn components for form elements
- Prefer const arrow functions over regular functions
