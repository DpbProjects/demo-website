# Testing (Convex-first, Minimal)

**Scope now:** Backend tests with `convex-test` for queries, mutations, actions, schedules, and auth rules.
**Later:** Frontend unit/integration (Jest/Vitest + RTL + MSW) and E2E (Playwright).

## What to test (now)

- **Queries**: filtering, pagination, visibility.
- **Mutations**: validation and business rules (include one negative case).
- **Actions**: external calls orchestrations (use fakes/stubs, no real network).
- **Auth**: who can read/write/delete (at least one deny case).
- **Schedules**: effects under fake timers (only if you have them).
